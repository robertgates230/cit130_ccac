If I can pay my bills, I'm good, I'm coming over
Found a message in my bottle, your son is coming up
"By the beer, by ear, by boo"—what Yari saying?
You ain’t nothin' but a baby, your fear is growing up

Listen here, I say, my dude, and what you call it
It was Heaven at the bottom and peace from throwing up
"By the beer, by ear, by boo"—my Yari saying
You ain't nothin' but a baby, your fear is growing up

I think I do this shit for real, dawg, hey
I ain't no motherfucking maybe
I'm for motherfucking real, dawg, hey
Mama, mama

I got some dollars for your bills, dawg, hey (Bills, dawg)
Now I'm the heading, I'm the topic
All that matters, I'm Jaleel, dog, hey
Yeah, you know, I think the sunshine

Should feel how I feel, how I feel, like, yeah
I think at night time
The moon should call my phone
Hit my line, I'm here for you

And Eastside, shame on us
Rain, come on now
I figured the mood
I figure, I figure
